\section{Overview}
%Brief textual description of the role of this high-risk component in the overall project
Like any embedded system a microcontroller that is cost effective and provides adequate hardware
for the requirements of the system is needed.  These requirements being to operate the mechanical 
communication aspects of the feeder.  It must have available documentation and easy to use
toolchains, with useful SDKs, for efficient development.  
%An engine controller, like any electrical device requires power to function properly. 
% The system is heavily constrained by both weight and size requirements and thus must be 
% developed carefully to ensure compliance. The power systems will be responsible for delivering 
% power to both the electrical components, such as microcontrollers, and mechanical components, 
% like valves. 
\section{Risk specification}
Marketing requirements relevant for microcontrollers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{auto}Supplementary and Master Feeders should operate unattended
    \item\label{wifi}Supplementary and Master Feeders should be able to connect to a wireless network
    \item\label{network}Master Feeder should be able to brodcast localized network for managing Suplementary Feeders
    \item\label{storage}Master Feeder should be able to store feeding schedules and the amount of food eaten by owners pets
\end{enumerate}
The relevant specifications can be found in \autoref{tab:specs}.

    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{cXX} \toprule
        Marketing Requirement(s) & Engineering Requirement & Justification \\ \midrule
        \ref{auto},\ref{wifi},\ref{network},\ref{storage}            & \engineerthis{elight}Suplementary Feeders need to be able to transmit and recieve data to and from master feeder on a private localized network.  & Allow for automation of supplementary feeders, without interfering with owners network if any, and to reduce cost for owners of multiple pets.\\
        \ref{wifi},\ref{network}              & \engineerthis{eremote} Suplementary and Master Feeders need wireless pheripherals or to be able to integrate with a wireless module.& Needed to permit network communication between Master and Suplementary feeders.\\
        \ref{network},\ref{network},\ref{storage}              & \engineerthis{epressure} User needs to be able to communicate with Master Feeder via its localized network or the User's personal network.& Needed to allow for user to configure eating times and food portions in pet profiles\\
        \ref{auto}              & \engineerthis{etemp}Supplementary and Master Feeders should be able to measure food dispensed and detect pets& Needed to adequately feed pet/s when it is their feeding time.\\

    %– Availability—(vendor information, including lead time from order placement to delivery)
\section{Testing strategy}
%Plan for verification of proper component/subsystem operation within the project’s
%particular operating environment. The plan should include what will be measured/tested
%along with an estimate of when. (Notes: 1. manufacturer’s performance specifications are
%often unachievable in practice, [e.g., new car mileage estimates]; 2. testing sooner is much
%better than later— whether this high-risk component will perform adequately in the overall
%project system needs to be determined as early as possible.)
\section{Uncertainties}
%Any remaining doubts or questions about using or testing this component/subsystem—any
%concerns the author or other team members have about this aspect of the project.
\section{Appendices}
%Copies of (or links to) the manufacturer’s literature on the component/subsystem—
%especially technical specification(s) and application notes.
