so i need to sort my thoughts
==========================================================================================
We need to store information about pets in the DB
    we will keep this in JSON in order to be able to send this off to the app and recieve
    it in the same format.
    -this information also needs to be deserialized into an object to decide to operate on
    -these classes will be used to determine when/how much to feed
        -default schedule vs programmed schedule

We need to store data about dynamic feedings
    when in dynamic mode:
        1: animal approaches
        2: feed initiated
        3: update feeding db: [<pet>,<timestamp>]
            -allows us to sort by pet,day, month, year

============================================================================================
dynamic feedings vs scheduled feedings

Dynamic:
#define schedule breaks==> dont feed on schedule but block dynamic feeds until break

03:00|--------|12:00|--------|20:00|--------|03:00|--...
      \      /       \      /       \      /
       1 feed         1 feed         1 feed


Scheduled:

03:00|----------|12:00|----------|20:00|----------|03:00|--...
      \        /       \        /       \         /
^feed^  _ignore_ ^feed^  _ignore_ ^feed^  _ignore_

So major refactoring is needed
http server being replaced with flask so total server re-write

this led to disocvery of little to no error checking
need to work over:
    database_manager
    db_test
