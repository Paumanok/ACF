We need to formalize python dependencies with pip and virtual env 
later

for now this is what I'm working with:

    Python3:
        pymongo
        json
        bson

    Linux:
        python3
        mongodb v2.6 --- hoping this is the one in the raspberian repos
                        as its the one in the fedora repos
